     <h2>Foo Driver</h2>
     <p>This is a simple driver using a hyperbolic tan function. The plugin can also control the offset of the distortion. This plugin was introduced in version 1.0</p>

    <h3>parameters</h3>

    <table class="plugin-parameters">
     <tr><th>input gain</th><td>Input gain of the signal. The difference between <i>drive</i> and <i>input gain</i> is that input gain is added both to the dry and the wet signal.</td></tr>
     <tr><th>drive</th><td>Gain control for the part of the signal fed into the distortion function.</td></tr>
     <tr><th>offset</th><td>DC offset added into the distorted signal to create asymmetric distortion. The offset is attempted to remove from the signal after the distortion, but may not always work, a high-pass filter is recommended in these cases.</td></tr>
     <tr><th>balance</th><td>Controls the balance between dry and wet signal in the output.</td></tr>
