    <table class="plugins">
	<tr><th>Limiter</th><td>A limiter designed to deal nicely with disproportionate transients in the signal. <a href="foo_limiter.html">More information</a>.</td></tr>
	<tr><th class="experimental">Foo Limiter 2</th><td>An improved(?) version of the former, but sadly it was in development years ago and it is unclear whether it is finished or not.</td></tr>
	<tr><th>Transient Architect</th><td>A transient processor which works somewhat like a compressor without thresholds. <a href="foo_transients.html">More information</a>.</td></tr>
	<tr><th>Driver</th><td>A simple overdrive plugin based on the htan (hyperbolic tangent function) function. <a href="foo_driver.html">More information</a>.</td></tr>
	<tr><th>Chop Liver</th><td>Distortion inspired by an SSE ordering bug. It chops the signal into smal bits which are mixed in with the dry signal in reverse order.<td></tr>
	<tr><th class="experimental">Saturator</th><td> More distortion. It's based on something. I'm sure I have an irc log somewhere which would tell me what it does .. </td></tr>
	<tr><th class="experimental">t00b Limiter</th><td> Some sort of experimental limiter based more on distortion characteristics than time constants.</td></tr>

    <h2>News</h2>
    <p><b>Mar 8th 2009</b>, Version 1.2 released. This release contains a lot of stuff I don't even remember if they are finished or not. Let's hope they don't screw up your system</p>
    <p>New plugins: Foo Chop Liver, Foo Limiter 2, Foo Saturator and t00b Limiter</p>

    <p>Use at your own caution. Chop Liver should work fine as it's so simple, but I'm not 100% about where I left the others when I stopped working on them. The docs are not up yet, but writing them requires me to actually remember exactly what they do.</p>

       
    <p><b>Jan 14th 2007</b>, Version 1.0 released. The release contains a new plugin, the <a href="foo_driver.html">Foo Driver</a>. The <a href="foo_limiter.html">Foo Limiter</a> release can be set to a logarithmic curve. Unfortunately, the plugins are not "stable" enough yet to guarantee that the parameters will not change in the future.</p>
    <p>There is also a patch for <a href="http://jamin.sf.net/">Jamin</a> available. The patch makes Jamin use the Foo Limiter instead of swh's Fast Lookahead Limiter. Note that you might need to use longer release times for the Jamin limiter stage as the patch will set up the limiter to use a logarithmic release curve (parameter value 0.75).</p>
