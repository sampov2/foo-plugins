    The actual type is defined by the type URI of the UI.
    All the functionality provided by this extension is toolkit
    independent, the host only needs to pass the necessary callbacks and
    display the widget, if possible. Plugins may have several UIs, in various
    toolkits. */

/** This handle indicates a particular instance of a UI.

/** This handle indicates a particular plugin instance, provided by the host.

/** This is the type of the host-provided function that the UI can use to
    send data to a plugin's input ports. The @c buffer parameter must point
    to a block of data, @c buffer_size bytes large. The contents of this buffer
    and what the host should do with it depends on the value of the @c format
    parameter.

    The @c format parameter should either be 0 or a numeric ID for a "Transfer
    mechanism". Transfer mechanisms are Features and may be defined in
    meta-extensions. They specify how to translate the data buffers passed
    to this function to input data for the plugin ports. If a UI wishes to
    write data to an input port, it must list a transfer mechanism Feature
    for that port's class as an optional or required feature (depending on
    whether the UI will work without being able to write to that port or not).
    The only exception is when the UI wants to write single float values to
    input ports of the class lv2:ControlPort, in which case @c buffer_size
    should always be 4, the buffer should always contain a single IEEE-754
    float, and @c format should be 0.

    The numeric IDs for the transfer mechanisms are provided by a
    URI-to-integer mapping function provided by the host, using the URI Map
    feature <http://lv2plug.in/ns/ext/uri-map> with the map URI
    "http://lv2plug.in/ns/extensions/ui". Thus a UI that requires transfer
    mechanism features also requires the URI Map feature, but this is
    implicit - the UI does not have to list the URI map feature as a required
    or optional feature in it's RDF data.

    An UI MUST NOT pass a @c format parameter value (except 0) that has not
    been returned by the host-provided URI mapping function for a
    host-supported transfer mechanism feature URI.

    The UI MUST NOT try to write to a port for which there is no specified
    transfer mechanism, or to an output port. The UI is responsible for
    allocating the buffer and deallocating it after the call.

      @param descriptor The descriptor for the UI that you want to instantiate.

      @param bundle_path The path to the bundle containing the RDF data file
                         that references this shared object file, including the

      @param controller A handle for the plugin instance that should be passed
                        as the first parameter of @c write_function.
      @param widget     A pointer to an LV2UI_Widget. The UI will write a

                        depends on the RDF class of the UI) that will be the
                        main UI widget.
      @param features   An array of LV2_Feature pointers. The host must pass
                        all feature URIs that it and the UI supports and any
                        additional data, just like in the LV2 plugin
                        instantiate() function. Note that UI features and plugin
			features are NOT necessarily the same, they just share
			the same data structure - this will probably not be the
			same array as the one the plugin host passes to a
			plugin.

  /** Tell the UI that something interesting has happened at a plugin port.
      What is interesting and how it is written to the buffer passed to this
      function is defined by the @c format parameter, which has the same
      meaning as in LV2UI_Write_Function. The only exception is ports of the
      class lv2:ControlPort, for which this function should be called
      when the port value changes (it does not have to be called for every
      single change if the host's UI thread has problems keeping up with
      the thread the plugin is running in), @c buffer_size should be 4 and the
      buffer should contain a single IEEE-754 float. In this case the @c format
      parameter should be 0.

      By default, the host should only call this function for input ports of
      the lv2:ControlPort class. However, the default setting can be modified
      by using the following URIs in the UI's RDF data:
      <pre>
      uiext:portNotification
      uiext:noPortNotification
      uiext:plugin
      uiext:portIndex
      </pre>
      For example, if you want the UI with uri
      <code><http://my.pluginui></code> for the plugin with URI
      <code><http://my.plugin></code> to get notified when the value of the
      output control port with index 4 changes, you would use the following
      in the RDF for your UI:
      <pre>
      <http://my.pluginui> uiext:portNotification [ uiext:plugin <http://my.plugin> ;
                                                      uiext:portIndex 4 ] .
      </pre>
      and similarly with <code>uiext:noPortNotification</code> if you wanted
      to prevent notifications for a port for which it would be on by default
      otherwise. The UI is not allowed to request notifications for ports of
      types for which no transfer mechanism is specified, if it does it should
      be considered broken and the host should not load it.

      The @c buffer is only valid during the time of this function call, so if
      the UI wants to keep it for later use it has to copy the contents to an
      internal buffer.

      This member may be set to NULL if the UI is not interested in any
      port events.
